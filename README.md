# Bioinformatics-Project
This project aims to create a semi-automatic identification pipeline using the command line to be able to process thousands of sequences (queries) in a single run, with the overall aim to create user-friendly output files depicting BLAST percentage identities and robust phylogenetic relationships information using a maximum likelihood approach.
